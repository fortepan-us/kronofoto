41_Leonard Curtis_1864c,Leonard ,Curtis,1864,1,Leonard Curtis,,,,,,USA,"Location: This photograph was taken at a studio in Washington, D.C.
 
 People: The sitter is Private Aquila France from Menasha, Wisconsin.
 
 Activity: Private France was first mustered for service in Company C of the 10th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry on September 3, 1861. Taken prisoner at Murfreesboro, Tennessee and contracting Typhoid Fever, he was released in a prisoner exchange and discharged with a disability on July 20, 1862. He re-enlisted in Company B of the 37th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry on March 31, 1864 and was discharged on July 27, 1865. Given that the 37th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry served in the Virginia theatre of war, it is likely that this photograph was taken in 1864, near the beginning of his second term of service. After his discharge, he returned to Wisconsin working as a farmer and a carpenter, eventually homesteading with his family on a farm in Wall Lake Township, Wright County, Iowa.",2013-12-01

32_Leonard Curtis_1895c,Leonard ,Curtis,1895,1,Leonard Curtis,,,Webster City,Hamilton,IA,USA,"This is the only known photograph of the early R. R. 3 neighborhood mailboxes for Mulberry Center
 
 People: N. L. Maxon, mail-carrier (standing next to mailboxes) and Aquila France (standing next to carriage).
 
 Activity: This photograph appears to be one of two commissioned by Mr. France to commemorate pioneer life in the Mulberry Center community (the other is image no. 33). Mr. Maxon and Mr. France are standing at the intersection of two roads at the SE corner of the NE ¼ of Section 6, Blairsburg Township, Hamilton County, Iowa. Thus the view in the photo is towards the NNW showing the NW corner of the intersection, the location of the neighborhood mailboxes until the late 1950s. Note that the roads are little more than paths over the prairie, having no grade, no road-bed, and no surface treatment.",2013-12-01
33_Leonard Curtis_1895c,Leonard ,Curtis,1895,1,Leonard Curtis,,,Blairsburg,Hamilton,IA,USA,"Location: This building was the home of the Prairie Queen Creamery Company located on the SW corner of the NW ¼ of Section 6, Blairsburg Township. The creamery was a collection point for local cream production and was a stop on a cream collecting route originating in Clarion, Iowa, and ending in Webster City, Iowa (see article by local historian Ed Nass).
 
 People: The man on the light colored horse in the center of the photograph is Aquila France, a local pioneer and Civil War veteran who, as noted in an article by local historian Ed Nass, served as the Secretary for the company. According to my grandmother, Myrtle France Curtis (1888-1972), this building was one of an enclave of buildings that occupied three of the four corners of the intersection. She recalled a blacksmith shop on the NW corner, and a Woodsmen of the World dance hall on the SE corner. The SW corner was part of the farm occupied by her relatives (uncle William Henry France, Aunt Jenny France, and cousins Ralph, Earl, Raymond, Ethel, George, and Melford France). Surface collections conducted there in the late 1970s yielded numerous pottery and glassware fragments, in addition to a 1919 Liberty dime, suggesting that the creamery included a small dry goods store. My grandmother told a story of purchasing a sewing card as a girl she probably purchased it there (I still have the completed sewing card, featuring a stitched image of a rooster). Among my grandmother’s things was a turquoise and white glass hen-on-nest trinket box that may have come from the Prairie Queen. Fragments of an identical box were found on the site during the 1970s surface collection.",2013-12-01

 Location: The Mulberry Center Church
 
 Activity: This photograph shows the participants in the Blairsburg Township Sunday School Convention that took place at Mulberry Center Church on August 2, 1896. The Mulberry Center Church was located near the NW corner of the SW 1/4 of section 5, Blairsburg Township, Hamilton County, Iowa. A historical sketch housed in the collection of the Mulberry Center Helping Hand Club at the Kendall Young library offers an account of the early church: “The Mulberry Center United Brethren Church in Christ was organized in 1887 with 52 members and held church services in the school house that was located ¼ mile south of the present church….Plans for a church building were in progress by 1889….A one-room frame church building, with no basement, was erected and dedicated July 18, 1890….A Mrs. Morris lived [sic] the first place south of the church. She had planted many mulberry trees around her home and along the road. Thus the name was chosen.” Aquila France served as the building supervisor. Rachael Flinn was among the first members of the congregation (Carolynn Miller has in her possession a ledger book with the names of the first congregants). A marker now designates the place where the church once stood and the church itself was moved in the 1980s to the Bonebright Park and Museum, Webster City, Iowa.",2013-12-01

36_Leonard Curtis_1899c,Leonard ,Curtis,1899,1,Leonard Curtis,,,Blairsburg,Hamilton,IA,USA,"Location: This is the original farmstead of Charles Marston France and Rachael Ann Flinn France . This house was located near the SW corner of the NE 1/4 quarter of section 6, Blairsburg Township, Hamilton County, Iowa.
 
 People: Rachael Flinn France (1857-1941), Myrtle Jane France (1888-1972), and Charles Marston France (1858-1913).
 
 Activity: My grandmother related the story that when the photographer arrived for this photograph, her father was occupied with a task and refused to change into dress clothes for the photograph. She also told me that her father started work on the house around 1882, building the south part first (left in the photo) and then completing the north part (right in the photo) sometime near the year of her birth (1887 or 1888). The house featured a parlor that was only used to entertain guests and an adjacent guest bedroom. The dining room had an exterior door so hired hands were not required to walk through the kitchen when they entered the house for a meal. Tangent to the west side of the kitchen was a pantry with a serving window in the wall between the pantry and the dining room. This house was demolished in the late 1970s.",2013-12-01

 Activity: Around 1903, Charles, Rachael, and Myrtle France moved off the farm to a residence on Seneca Street in Webster City. The purpose of the move was to allow Myrtle to attend high school.

The connection with Aquila France would explain why my grandmother possessed at least two prints of this photograph.
 
 Activity: Because most are wearing a G.A.R. uniform with a special ribbon, they must be attending an event commemorating an important aspect of the Civil War, perhaps the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, which would date the photo to 1915, a date that corresponds well with their clothing and the process using to print the photo.",2013-12-01

Old postcard addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Karns and family from Anne Neuchterlein. June 21. “Dear friends, I’ve been in Germany for exactly a week and have loved every minute of it. We are walking in an old hospital of about 100 patients and doing aid work. The German language is coming fairly well but we have to work at it. We are making our way throughout the hospital with the little translation dictionary we carry around. We live in a nurses’ residence and have a lovely room at the corner of the building where we look out on mountains at every side. Budingen is very old, (1414) and has most of its medieval city wall yet a castle too! It was in the castle chapel that we heard our first concert presented by the Renaissance Music Association. Their Bach improvisation was just incredible! The women play soprano and alto recorders and had very fine technique including dynamic differences with little or no pitch problems. The three instuments were very well played together. Give my love to Meredith, Morgan, Garret, and Risë . Sincerely yours, Anne.”",2014-12-01

It is double exposed. At the time, Dale was interested in photography. He was experimenting with different photographing techniques. He was getting ready to start shooting weddings. To get a double exposure, one would cover up part of the lens with a black card and then take the picture. That would expose the portion that wasn’t covered. Then, there was a film release button on the bottom of the camera that one would push, hold, and then one would cock the camera with the film advance lever. This would recock the camera but would not advance the film. Then one would put the black card over the portion of the lens that was used the first time, then retake the picture of whatever else was wanted in the double exposed picture.

After Eric had been taking lessons for a couple of years, he wanted a new, better guitar. He saw this Alvarez guitar and Dale and Carol said if he saved up half, they would buy the other half. Eric had an old coffee can in which he saved the money; birthday money, money from pop bottles, etc. He saved for about a year. This picture was taken shortly after purchasing the new guitar. Interesting fact, Eric’s son Riley Higgins got a guitar from his parents for Christmas one year. After playing for a few years, Riley wanted a better guitar. Riley’s parents said they would pay half if he saved up the money. Riley saved up his half by scooping dog poop for the neighbor’s dog, Jackson.

Eric stayed home from school one day because he took the wrong amount of insulin. His mom had premixed it and accidentally gave him the wrong amount. Carol was afraid to send him to school and wanted to keep an eye on him. Carol made a special treat for Eric, a big pan of peanut butter fudge, because she gave him too much insulin. They had been watching this cat several times and could never get him, so Eric put a warm pan of milk outside of a vent hole that went underneath house where the cat had been living. Eric coaxed him out with warm milk and was able to pet him. Carol and Eric took him inside, where they had cleared out an old toy box with blankets at the bottom that they sat on the kitchen table. They were petting him and he was loving the attention. They closed the toy box lid and when Dale came home they opened up the lid, and he said, ‘no way’. They begged and pleaded and Dale gave in. He became one of the best pets that they had. He would bolt outside when they opened the doors but he always came back. One time, he was an older cat, he got outside and the neighbor saw it happen, he bolted across the street and was hit by a car. The Higgins family had many fond memories of the cat.",2015-12-01

Eric had taken the new puppy over to show grandma and grandpa, Ora and Ruth Hickerson. Ginger was the pet that Eric and his father wanted but his mother did not. Dale and Eric used to drive out to Geode State Park and on the way out there there was always this big dog. It was a mix between a black lab and golden retriever. They stopped and talked to the dog’s owner to find out what breed the dog was. When Eric was a freshman in high school, his father came to him with the evening newspaper, and it had an ad for black lab golden retriever puppies to give away. Dale and Eric snuck over to the house without Carol knowing it. Some puppies were all black, but what they really wanted was the goldish red one like the dog they had always admired. They placed all of the gold puppies and set them on the driveway. Eric went to the end of the driveway and when the owner set the puppies down, this one puppy just ran straight to Eric. It was just like as soon as he set them down, all of the puppies went everywhere, but one ran straight to Eric and that was the one they picked. They picked the name Ginger because of her coloring and because Dale had a favorite pet with that name when he was a child.",2015-12-01

Resources would set up spotting scopes along the river to watch the bald eagles go down in the river and catch fish. They would also set a spotting scope on their nests. These scopes were set up on an old bridge in the park. The Raptor Center from MN would also come down and give presentations about birds of prey.

Jay was a journalism major and a photography buff like Eric. He was taking a photography class and he was supposed to do an assignment on something funny. The house they lived in had this poster, of the girl, which covered a big hole in the wall because the guys who lived in the house before them had a big party and trashed the house. To cover the hole, they put this poster over it and left the poster when they moved out of the house. For the assignment, Jay wanted Eric to wear the slippers and the shorts and get on the phone and be the same position as the girl in the phone booth so it looked like he was talking to her. This was the impression that he wanted to give. However, there was no particular reasoning behind the bear slippers. Eric used to call this house the wind tunnel because there were places around the windows that weren’t sealed up or insulated.

The man on the top right, Jack, used to own a fancy watch, which he received from his first lover that would take him everywhere. When he re-married, he gave it to his wife however she didn’t stay with him for very long and gave him the watch back broken. He had to scavenge missing parts from thrift stores to try and repair it, but even the repair shops couldn’t fix the watch, so they all thought it was broken for good. Jack had a romantic interest in my cousin Amy, and so he gave her the watch and said it attached a lot of meaning to it. When she put on the broken watch, it started working again which was super strange. We think that the strong connection of the watch would only be felt again when being put on someone extremely special like she was to him.",2016-05-01

08_Bettina Fabos_1907,Catherine ,Palczewski,1907,0,Bettina Fabos,F.J. Bandholtz,2401 Wisconsin St,Cedar Falls,Black Hawk,IA,USA,"""Dear Friends,
 Us girls, that is Cora J, Mabel B, and I, arrived in Cedar Falls about 3:20 Sat; came up on a street car to Normal Hill. It seems to be a very pleasant situation. Mabel and I room at 2500 Olive St. take our meals at 2516 about a block distance, the place where Cora J. boards. The train from Marshalltown was very, very crowded with students all bound for Cedar Falls. Street car was also crowded. We through Cora’s official ability and management obtained a seat in Car. After disposing four suitcases we went over to the College and enrolled, we are just 2 blocks from main building. Our trunks did not arrive until Sunday evening owing to the fact that the train from Marshalltown was an excursion train. We attended the Methodist Church Sunday morning and evening. It is about 2 ½ miles from Normal Hill. Thus we went down on car as Mabel was not feeling very well. It was flag day and they had flag day and children’s day exercises in the Morning. The Church is a very large building, and was decorated very beautiful, they had a splendid program both morning and evening. The singing and music was grand. Prof. C.A. Fullerton sang 2 very beautiful selections. Today we had classes in the afternoon first class was at 1:30 to 2:00 after today we will have hour periods, Monday.
 
 This morning after purchasing a few books we went over to the College had a very pleasant talk with President Seerley. He seemed to be a very pleasant man. I think I will like all the profs and teachers. I am taking 2 full credits and reviewing two studios. Mabel is taking 1 full credit and reviewing 3 studios. I am taking “Methods” under Mr. Dick. He is a splendid teacher. I find a great deal of difference between a College Prof. and a High School Prof. College Profs are so much more inspiring…I am learnin. I began the “deed” after entering the depot at Colo. I learned there to wait and get my trunk check. We have had various experiences some very pleasant others as Mabel and Cora terms it “laughable.” Mabel and I had 2 grand towels to use Sunday. I will tell you about them when I come home. I know you have never used such and the like, for thy are Cedar Falls (style) “C.” Dr. Hartwell informed us girls Sat. that he was going to Waterloo in the near future. Tell him that if he is going there to make any purchase, that a gentleman up here informed us girls that “we could get everything we wished here at Cedar Falls instead of spending Car fare to go up to Waterloo, Because Cedar Falls articles is just just fine. For Cedar Falls is just just Grand. Waterloo’s is not Better, because you have to put extra car fare into them but on top of them. He said all note “Don’t spend your well, hard earned money for nothing.”
 
 Cora informed him that spending it for car fare is not spending it for nothing, but for something. Guess from the way he talked he thought we were old experienced school teachers. I finally succeeded in getting a key to my trunk. That is one that works better than the one which I had. Tuesday eve, we just got home from one of the numbers of the lecture course. It was a Concert – the Normal Orchestra. I liked it quite well, altho I am very tired, would not attend another one of the same kind. We are meeting folks from almost all over. One lady who boards at the house where Cora boards is a girl from Texas. She certainly is different from the other girls. Well.""
