**Kronofoto** is an extremely user-friendly upload and display tool, which arranges images along a simple but engaging timeline. Using Kronofoto, users can fast forward toward the present or backward deeper into the past. The code for Kronofoto can be used for all sorts of different collection types beyond photographs.

Unlike archive-style digital repositories, which often mirror the priorities of physical archives and divide collections by provenance, Kronofoto prioritizes the experience of browsing to explore images of the past by time, supported by robust metadata, tagging, and search features. This creates a fundamentally different viewing experience than clicking around in segmented collectionsâ€“more delightful, more diverse, more holistic, more grounded in the social history of a collection.


Kronofoto features a suite of tools to engage the public in visual history and customize user experience. 
MyList allows researchers and creators to create customized lists of photos according to their own interests and needs. Lists are viewable in grid or timeline view, and can be saved for future reference, shared with others, and even embedded into a website. 

* **Embed** allows community institutions to embed any version of a collection into their own website (for example, all the photos from their particular town; all the musical programs from a particular year) making images most relevant to their publics immediately available. 

* **Exhibit** (in development) empowers users to curate a digital exhibit or story. Users will be able to draw upon any image from the Kronofoto portal and insert it into a variety of text + image template options, which  create a dynamic vertical exhibit with parallax scrolling. Users will also be able to embed their final exhibits into another website.

* **Krono360** (in development) is an immersive visual geolocation tool that exactly and beautifully situates historic photographs in the modern landscape with an immersive degree of visual precision.

# Install the dependencies:

You must use Python 3. Optionally, you probably should use a virtual environment:

    python -m venv kfenv
    source kfenv/bin/activate
    
Install dependencies:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure kronofoto:

Copy the examplesettings.py file in the kronofoto directory to settings.py. Fill in the missing values.

Run the migrations:

    ./manage.py migrate

Create the cache table:

    ./manage.py createcachetable
    
Create a superuser account:

    ./manage.py createsuperuser

The test server can then be started up:

    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

You will also need to log into the admin and [change the site domain](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/sites/site/) from example.com to 127.0.0.1:8000.
